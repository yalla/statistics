# Earthquakes in Turkey
Toying around with `ggmap`. I grabbed some historical earthquake data from
Wikipedia and plotted the quakes as points on an OpenStreetoMap.

Since the magnitude data is imperfect and I was to lazy to clean up the mess,
the magnitudes and hence the size of the points are garbled.

The countour lines don't mean anything meaningful, I just found it fancy.
